# 📝 Project Title: COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
## 📌 Project Description:

In this project, learners will build a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project will analyze cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. Learners will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools.

By the end, they’ll have a data analysis report with visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.

## 🚩 Project Objectives:

✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data
